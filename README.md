## Todos Platform

Playground for me to try out infra as code solutions.

[![ci-build](https://github.com/ssimmie/todos-platform/actions/workflows/push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ssimmie/todos-platform/actions/workflows/push.yml)

Platform for the [Todos Application](https://github.com/ssimmie/todos).

## Development Approach 

- [ ] Test Driven Development; unit testing with coverage backstop
- [ ] Acceptance testing; ensure platform matches desired behaviours
- [x] [Pulumi project](https://app.pulumi.com/ssimmie/todos-platform)
- [ ] ECR to host application images
- [ ] AWS AppRunner for application runtime
- [ ] AWS Keyspaces as app persistent store
